Getting and Cleaning Data Project CodeBook

This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
	• The site where the data was obtained:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+SmartphonesThe data for the project:https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
	
	• Variables:
		1. mergeData = used to load files into one dataset.  This variable is removed from global environment once data is subset.
		2. mergeActivity = used to load training and test data for labels into one dataset.  This variable is used in final merging of cleaned dataset to display Activity label.  There are 6 possible labels in the data.
		3. mergeSubject = used to load training and test data into one source dataset for cleaning activity
		4. features = Variable used to read ./features.txt file then used to subset data.  This variable is removed from global environment once no longer used in activity.
		5. meanStdIndices = used to create an index of features t that contain mean and std to subset data.  This variable is removed from global environment once no longer used in activity.
		6. MeanStdData = used to subset mergeData using meanStdIndices.  The variable mergeData is removed after the creation of this variable.
		7. activity = used to read ./activity_labels.txt file then used to apply those labels to mergeActivity variable.  This variable is removed once results are applied to activityLabel.
		8. activityLabel = used as the labels for each row of data once created from the activity variable and the mergeActivity variable.  This variable is removed once results are applied to mergeActivity variable.
		9. cleanedData = Clean Tidy Dataset of Subject, Activity, and Variables for mean and Standard Diviation
		10. cleanedGroup = Data Table of summarized cleanedData when all column variables are averaged and grouped by Activity and Subject
	
	• The run_analysis.R script performs the following steps to clean the data:
		1. Read X_train.txt and X_test.txt into mergeData
		2. Read y_train.txt and y_test.txt into mergeActivity
		3. Read subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt into mergeSubject
		4. Read the features.txt file into features
		5. Create meanStdIndices as a subset of features when mean and std are in the column variable name.
		6. Subset mergeData into MeanStdData using meanStdIndices
		7. Read the activity_labels.txt file into activity
		8. Clean and standardize activity labels to use camel case on labels.
		9. Clean and standardize header labels of variables in MeanStdData
		10. Add header names to mergeActivity and mergeSubject
		11. Remove features, activity, and meanStdIndices from global environment
		12. Consolidate mergeSubject, mergeActivity and mergeData into one dataset, cleanedData.
		13. Write output of cleanedData to cleaned_data.txt file.
		14. Produce mean of variables by Activity and Subject of cleanedData into smaller table cleanedGroup.
		15. Write output of cleanedGroup to Summary_Data_Means.txt excluding row names.
